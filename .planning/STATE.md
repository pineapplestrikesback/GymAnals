## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: SwiftData chosen over GRDB for Apple ecosystem alignment
- [Init]: User-defined muscles with weighted contributions (core differentiator)
- [Init]: Gym-specific exercise branches to solve multi-gym variance
- [01-01]: Fully qualified enum defaults for SwiftData macro compatibility
- [01-01]: 31-muscle taxonomy balanced for accuracy and usability
- [01-01]: Cascade delete on parent relationships only
- [01-02]: Feature-based folder structure for scalability
- [01-02]: Tab enum centralizes tab configuration (title, icon)
- [01-02]: NavigationStack per tab for independent navigation stacks
